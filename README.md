# Assanify-Chatbot

# Project Overview
Here, we suggest a method that enables users to conduct Asanify HRMS and payroll services directly from their WhatsApp chat window Or an MS Teams app installed for the organization without opening any other windows. Here, users must enter their inquiries, and our system will interact with Asanify services and databases to come up with the best response using AI and ML technologies.
The chatbot, a virtual assistant, uses RASA AI to respond to inquiries. The services include Attendance, leave, leave balance, about asanify, etc...

# Tools Used:
1) Whatsapp Business API -> to recieve and send whatsapp messages
2) Ngrok -> setting up endpoints, recieving and sending messages
3) RASA NLU engine -> Chatbot architecture
4) Python -> Codebase and chatbot
5) Flask -> App Deployment
